This project is HEAVILY incomplete and has many issues (it still doesn't even do many of the basic things that a lifesteal mod does)
I would not recommend using it unless you try and fix these issues first.

Other than that this mod it free to use you can change it in any way that you wish and use in any modpacks is fine with me.
